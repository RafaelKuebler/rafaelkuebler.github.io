  <h1>What am I Doing</h1>
  
  <p>First of all, I somehow feel compelled to say that I don't know what I am doing, where this is going, or how it will continue.<br>
My one and only New Year's resolution for the year 2025 was to start and publish a blog, not even to write regularly, just to put it out there at first.<br>
This has previously been a struggle because of many issues that other (tech-y) writers probably have experienced: spending way too much time on finding a nice tech stack, template, and ideas, reflecting long and hard about what to write about, and finally and maybe most importantly impostor syndrome.<br>
I had all of these stock images already picked out that I wanted to place above each one of my posts. Now looking through them I just find them cheesy and unoriginal... Who knows, maybe I will change my opinion...</p>
<p>In the end, I guess I just found the discipline to actually and finally get started. Just that, a first and very small step into the unknown, towards something new and exciting.</p>
<p>I catch myself thinking again and again: who am I doing this for? Why? I don't expect external validation from my writing, in fact, I somehow wish this could stay private. I want to tell myself that I am doing this for me alone, a space to reflect and philosophize, where I can just write about whatever topics I find interesting right now.<br>
On the other hand, I admit that I have a small hope my mad ramblings might be at least curious to someone out there, in this big and too often very confusing world. Maybe even helpful.</p>
<p>So here you go, stranger :) I am truly happy you made your way here! Feel free to stick around and explore a little bit. You might find something interesting!</p>
