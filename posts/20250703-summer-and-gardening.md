One of the things I was looking forward to when moving to the new flat was the larger balcony and the connected possibilities.
While it is too narrow to properly sit and spend the whole day there, it is perfect for hanging some clothes out to dry or for a little hobby gardening!

This is how it is looking from the back garden area (since it lies on the opposite side of the street):

I bought the flowers in pots and simply moved them to the flower boxes. They have grown beautifully and require little to no maintenance.

My girlfriend would have preferred to grow all plants from seeds.
While I agree that is would have been much nicer, my previous experience has also been that there a many more things to watch out for.
Mainly, the saplings need a warm temperature initially, and keeping them inside of the flat mostly just led to fungus gnats.
Maybe I am just bad a watering them properly. In any case, it is just a lot more work.

Nevertheless, I agreed to give some mini-tomatoes a try!
They are looking good and healthy and are now positioned on the balcony, too.
I am not sure how long it will take for them to grow some actual tomatoes, but I hope it happens before summer is over.
