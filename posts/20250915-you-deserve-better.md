You deserve someone that wants to be with you.
You deserve someone that does not need convincing of you worth.
You deserve someone emotionally mature and stable, that communicates their feelings clearly and openly.

Currently, you are consumed by the emotions: the pain, the disappointment, and the betrayal.
But you will focus on the facts. You dodged a bullet.
This would have happened sooner or later, and it is good it happened now.

You don't need them. They need you. You are fine without them.

You gave everything, it will never be enough for the wrong person.
For the right person, you will be enough even on your worst days.

You will not give yourself up and put your mental stability on the line for someone that is not willing to do the same for you. You deserve someone that decides even in uncertain times that the relationship is more important than the discomfort. That shows up even if it is not their current first priority, and invests energy in you.

You gave up many things because you thought the next step would be a life together.
But you have time, and there is so much yet to see.
You will focus on what brings you joy. Meeting your friends and family, and others that truly care about you.
Attend random events, and do the things that you have always wanted to do.

You deserve better.
