      <title>Simplicity and Less</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20251207-simplicity-and-less/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been stressful lately.&lt;br&gt;
In part because everything always bunches up before Christmas, and the burnout has been building up for some months since the summer vacations, and in part because it is simply self-imposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society, work, our partners, and our family always tell us to do more. Go co-found a startup, try hard to be funny, build all your hobby projects this very evening.&lt;br&gt;
The hustle culture is praised as being ambitious and knowing what you want in life. That you are interesting and exciting in a world where dopamine hits need to be religiously supplied because - god forbid - we sit quietly on a couch together without consuming some kind of content. Always pushing and pushing until your body is exhausted and your mind can’t keep up with all the impact you are supposed to be creating and the to-do list that only grows.&lt;br&gt;
Why have one job if you can have 2? Why not volunteer on the side also? And practice for your guitar class. Or that language course. And always cook and eat healthy because your body is a temple. And exercise.&lt;br&gt;
And hobbies. Some people have like one hobby, their whole lives. Oh, but not you. You have 10 and you need to rotate through. And then you feel bad because the progress at each seems to have stagnated, and you will never be able to live up to your own expectations and the ones that others might have of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weird idea popped up in my head: what if, per season, we only had one hobby? You could sit down after work full of determination and focus fully on progressing that one thing.&lt;br&gt;
The underlying concept is that most of the time, we are surrounded by noise. It distracts, and it eats up mental bandwidth. Even if you theoretically have the time, the energy is just not there when the moment to work on something arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess they are the two extremes. The busy, manic, hectic, first option is not even that bad when you look at it: you are certainly making progress! Just look back at the state when you started weeks, months, or years ago! If you combine all hobbies, this is certainly impressive! Then why does it not feel like it? How does this feel &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; and frustrating at times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were expecting a conclusion or solution, I regret to say I don’t have one. If any, it would be that the pressure you are putting on yourself is the problem. Because you are overthinking and creating expectations around achieving progress instead of enjoying the process. And if a hobby is parked for some months: so what? The world is (probably) not going to end if you miss one event. Be kind to yourself, and remember what you are doing all of this for.&lt;br&gt;
For fun... right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Imperfect Role Models</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20251109-imperfect-role-models/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have heard repeatedly that it is vital to have at least one role model to look up to.&lt;br&gt;
They are supposed to inspire, motivate, and give you some sort of direction in which to develop.&lt;br&gt;
I find it interesting because, as someone who often struggles to see my own worth and be self-confident, I have found that a healthier way to approach growth is not to compare myself to others, but to reflect on my own growth. &amp;quot;Are you better than what you were yesterday?&amp;quot; would be the guiding question that avoids feelings of inappropriateness and insecurity while still evoking a sense of purpose and direction. Are we not different from everyone else? That means that aspiring to be like someone else basically makes no sense. You can be a better you, but you don&#39;t need to be better by being &amp;quot;like someone else&amp;quot; necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of my struggle comes from seeing others as what they are, as what &lt;em&gt;we all&lt;/em&gt; are: &lt;em&gt;just people&lt;/em&gt;. We all have our virtues and our flaws. This may sound cynical, but is it not just the reality we live in? Don&#39;t people we respected occasionally surprise and disappoint us when they suddenly appear on the news spewing some political bullshit? We are just a continuum of imperfect people striving towards what we believe is an improvement of our condition. How can I pick anyone to wholeheartedly take on as a role model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with some people about this, and we agreed that committing to a specific role model and embracing every side of them is impossible. Instead, we reached the consensus that &lt;em&gt;modular inspiration&lt;/em&gt; could be the way out of this one: picking only aspects of a person that we find inspiring and where we see them as an example to follow. This allows us to build a mosaic of role models, rather than locking in with a single idol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatives to role models for personal development could be more philosophically grounded, such as following an ethical or moral framework that serves as a compass. I.e., focusing on qualities we consider &amp;quot;righteous&amp;quot;: courage, generosity, humility. Striving towards an archetype that is bigger than all of us and will never reach, but fight to get closer to.&lt;br&gt;
Or then again, maybe we are supposed to create our own values and purpose. After all, the purest authenticity comes from acting as a free agent. Is living in this limbo of isolation even possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to embark on a short exploration phase where I try to define what my values are. Some kind of personal framework that I can look at and confidently support. A philosophy of care, compassion, integrity, and authenticity. I believe I will find role models who have attempted the same before me along the way!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GameJam Constraints</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20251026-gamejam-constraints/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot; a game! 🤩 Well, maybe finished is an overstatement. It is not like it is ready for general distribution or making money, far from it. But as a comedian once said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s mine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over this weekend, some awesome colleagues from Netlight organized a GameJam in the Munich office. This time, it was not only local; even our other offices in Stockholm and Helsinki participated!&lt;br&gt;
This is not my first Netlight GameJam. Other years at the same Netlight game jam, I first submitted the crappy &lt;a href=&quot;https://lazarus5000.itch.io/never-stop-minimarket&quot;&gt;Never Stop - Minimarket&lt;/a&gt; that I whipped up in 3 hours or so, and the much cooler &lt;a href=&quot;https://vhoruk.itch.io/how-to-summon-a-demon&quot;&gt;How to Summon a Demon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was the first jam that was held under the premise of a competition. And I am proud to say that my game &lt;a href=&quot;https://lazarus5000.itch.io/tower-trials&quot;&gt;Tower Trials&lt;/a&gt; was considered by the judges (actual professional game devs!) the winner of this edition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from being an incredibly fun GameJam, one of my insights was that working with constraints, such as being a solo dev, being unable to create any game assets or artwork, and the limited time and theme, made up for a pretty focused end result that even feels quite polished! For the first time in pretty much ever, I made use of the physics engine, leading to a game where the basic mechanics did not have to be programmed. Simply throw some blocks on a pile and see what happens. Playing with the pile and the gravity is fun in itself, so the only thing left was to slap some fun twists on top, and voila, we have a game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midway, someone told me about Tricky Towers, another game that I apparently unconsciously copied to a certain extent. Maybe this is also what generally holds us back sometimes - we try to incorporate elements from other known, successful games, which leads to frustration and a feeling of inferiority. Instead of spoiling and potentially disappointing myself prematurely, I decided to simply not look it up and just do my thing. I was able to prioritize pretty well and finish the base mechanics fast, which left some time for low-hanging juice-it-or-lose-it visual fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I am very happy with the end result and very excited to do more GameDev in my free time again. I am also excited about the fact that I can drop it wholeheartedly out there and consider it &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot;. If you have literally 5 minutes, head over and try it out! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lazarus5000.itch.io/tower-trials&quot;&gt;Click here to get to the game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shame</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250923-shame/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to Oktoberfest yesterday.&lt;br&gt;
I was actually looking forward to it, to blow off some steam and forget about my worries for at least a few minutes. I did not go for the last 2 years, and the memories I had from before that were that it was a stinky place full of tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a table reservation this time, so the environment was nice this time. My friends are great, and the conversation was chill. Even the food was surprisingly good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I drank way too much. To the point where I was falling around and embarrassing myself.&lt;br&gt;
An Australian bloke who could barely stay on his feet himself threatened that he would kill me because he thought I was chatting up his girlfriend. I lost a 50€ bill somewhere, and after waiting for some Flammkuchen I cannot remember a single thing anymore. I just remember miraculously opening the door to my place, stumbling into the kitchen to drink some water, shattering a plate on the floor, cutting myself on my little toe, bleeding everywhere, and then falling into bed and basically passing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up religiously at 8 this morning when the alarm rang to head to the office for work, but I still felt drunk and sick until noon. I did not tidy the shattered plate until a few minutes ago. Some blood splatters are still here and there, on some furniture and the laminate. The whole day has been like a trance. What the fuck am I doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun, but currently, I only feel shame. I feel guilty, dirty, and irresponsible.&lt;br&gt;
I will go to Oktoberfest again, but the moral is that I have to be an adult. I knew my limits, and I chose to ignore them. This is not about being risk-averse; I acted like an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Constants</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250920-constants/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is funny how things change constantly. Like, everything, drastically, very fast.&lt;br&gt;
As someone who is calm and reflected, I would just wish sometimes that things could just stay the same. If it is good, why change? As it turns out, humans and life itself are quite complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think my cravings for stability will ever be satisfied.&lt;br&gt;
You can even argue that the constant change is what &lt;a href=&quot;https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250224-wonder/&quot;&gt;makes life beautiful&lt;/a&gt;. Worth living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was walking up with a colleague and friend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/WYQuEzUBYv7jQEEz8&quot;&gt;Havana Club&lt;/a&gt;, a lovely bar in Munich with the best daiquiris I have ever had in my life, I noticed that almost every single time I had been there, one particular blond waiter had always attended me.&lt;br&gt;
Always friendly, polite, and helpful. Through breakups, sorrow, stress, but also wonderful and magical beginnings.&lt;br&gt;
And funnily enough, he was there, albeit with a shorter haircut. I asked him how long he had been working there, and he replied 6 years (I have been in Munich for 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weird thought popped into my head that, during my time in Munich, this waiter had been the only real constant in my life.&lt;br&gt;
Friend groups, hobbies, partners, flats, dreams, and aspirations. They all changed. Aside from my employer, everything has been constantly shifting. But that cocktail bar has been a refuge and haven for me in good and bad times. There, I cried and I laughed and flirted and was supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more constants, of course. My family, and some long-term friends that I am still in contact with. And nobody is to say that a recent variable cannot become a constant for the rest of your life.&lt;br&gt;
In a world in which everything is fleeting and fragile, is it up to us to take care of the things we value and want to preserve. It takes time and energy, and more often than not it feels easier to just ignore the bridge and let it burn down.&lt;br&gt;
New things are exciting - and I hope to experience so many more of them! But it is mystical and reassuring that there are some people who stand the test of time, unwavering, that you can come back to and call home.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You Deserve Better</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250915-you-deserve-better/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You deserve someone that wants to be with you.&lt;br&gt;
You deserve someone that does not need convincing of you worth.&lt;br&gt;
You deserve someone emotionally mature and stable, that communicates their feelings clearly and openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, you are consumed by the emotions: the pain, the disappointment, and the betrayal.&lt;br&gt;
But you will focus on the facts. You dodged a bullet.&lt;br&gt;
This would have happened sooner or later, and it is good it happened now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t need them. They need you. You are fine without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gave everything, it will never be enough for the wrong person.&lt;br&gt;
For the right person, you will be enough even on your worst days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will not give yourself up and put your mental stability on the line for someone that is not willing to do the same for you. You deserve someone that decides even in uncertain times that the relationship is more important than the discomfort. That shows up even if it is not their current first priority, and invests energy in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gave up many things because you thought the next step would be a life together.&lt;br&gt;
But you have time, and there is so much yet to see.&lt;br&gt;
You will focus on what brings you joy. Meeting your friends and family, and others that truly care about you.&lt;br&gt;
Attend random events, and do the things that you have always wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Risk-Taking</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250813-on-risk-taking/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My brother and I were talking just a few minutes before going out to the water to windsurf what equipment we were going to use. We are not pros, not even close. In fact, we are still making attempts to reduce the volume of our boards below 120 liters.&lt;br&gt;
And I was feeling spicy today: I would try out the 112L board they had for rent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard. The board was more unstable than the larger ones, the wind was gusty, and the water was quite choppy. But it went well - until it didn&#39;t. I went out quite far during the last round and fell harness-hook-first on the mast. The 90% carbon fibre mast immediately broke in half with a crack. The sail floated limply in the water.&lt;br&gt;
...Bad bad bad...!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there I was, 1.5km away from the beach, with 2-meter waves, and no way to sail back.&lt;br&gt;
I hoped for a rescue, but for some reason, I thought I remembered that this spot had none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started swimming, and it went quite well. Ignoring the instinct to panic, that is, because it is really hard to tell how fast you are advancing and how much water is still left between you and the beach, or if you are hopelessly drifting with the waves and the current. But you just have to keep swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I met my brother along the way and somehow managed to gesture and shout that my mast was broken. He sailed back, and before I knew it, a jet ski of the Red Cross was picking me up. Phew.&lt;br&gt;
That saved me a whole lot of swimming. Thanks, bro!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all ended well, but these things always eat at me from the inside out. It is a blend of shock, shame, inadequacy, remorse, and frustration. Comments always range from &amp;quot;Man, it happens&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Expensive hobby, huh?&amp;quot; and even the occasional &amp;quot;Thanks for regularly breaking equipment, Rafa!&amp;quot; 🫤 Not a great feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced the fastest way to progress is to take a risk and &amp;quot;just do it&amp;quot;. Many times, the only thing holding us back is ourselves, and if you never try, you will never know. Why did it feel so awful, though? It was hard, so hard, to just say &amp;quot;It does indeed just happen, and I am going to try again tomorrow!&amp;quot;. After all, there are consequences and real dangers: broken bones, costly equipment, or your reputation.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, I have always been on the cautious side of things. It is better to prevent than to mend, right? Always ask for permission, then you won&#39;t have to ask for forgiveness.&lt;br&gt;
However, I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to learn, and I want to make the mistakes that will happen sooner or later and see some progress. To come out of the water and say: &amp;quot;Hell yeah, I tried and it was hard, but I made it work&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think with a few tweaks, the weird feeling of failure could have been transformed into something more constructive. Some genuinely encouraging words, no sassy jokes, some well-meant advice, and hints on what to watch out for. A nudge to just go for it again the next time, and an acknowledgement for taking the risk and at least trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I guess in the same way that one cannot expect the person taking the risk to just &lt;em&gt;suck it up&lt;/em&gt; when it does not work out (because the feeling of failure is so hard-wired), one can not expect for the people surrounding them to be genuine and encouraging, because we only really have control over our own actions, and not the ones of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My learnings are twofold.&lt;br&gt;
First, I want to be a person who is less deterred by failure, recognizing that some real, permanent growth is happening. I will be courageous and bold before trying something new, when the little internal voice is telling me to stop because &amp;quot;everything will surely go horribly wrong and everyone is going to die&amp;quot;. The potential rewards outweigh the drawbacks. Also, the little voice has no idea what it is talking about.&lt;br&gt;
Second, I want to be a person who encourages others to take calculated risks, under the assumption that it is the fastest and best way to learn. I will recognize that occasional failures do happen and support anyone to give it another go with genuine appreciation and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can all be better, together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Diving and Mind Tricks</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250727-on-diving-and-mind-tricks/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I had my first SCUBA diving experience - and it was incredible!&lt;br&gt;
In the days leading up to it, I felt quite nervous. It was something completely new after all, and from what I have heard, it can be quite dangerous if proper precautions are not taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an introduction from the extremely competent, thorough, and friendly instructors, we strapped on the (heavy!) equipment and plunged into the water. And this is when it started:&lt;br&gt;
Close to the beach, we had to kneel down on the seabed and go through the basic skills. Emptying the goggles of water by pushing it out with air from our noses, equalizing the pressure in the ears, etc. While it is already weird to have a blocked nose and breathe only through your mouth, the thing that annoyed me most was the constant waves (I know, right hahaha).&lt;br&gt;
With each wave, I felt clumsier. They would flip me on my back, carry me into rocks, get my fins tangled up, and seem to make staying still on the seabed and following the instructors&#39; prompts completely impossible. With each wave, I was feeling more nervous and insecure. If this was the easy part, what was still ahead of me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled for approximately ten minutes, which felt like an eternity. The goggles were pressing on my nose uncomfortably, and I had the constant worry that the instructors were going to abort at any moment.&lt;br&gt;
And then something clicked. I either got used to it or I started actually thinking with my brain.&lt;br&gt;
I took a wider stance with my knees and tried to predict the waves to balance preemptively. I calmed down, slowed my breath, and tried to become one with the surroundings.&lt;br&gt;
And everything was immediately better in a matter of seconds. And from there, everything else &lt;em&gt;just worked&lt;/em&gt;™.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We swam out, even reached a depth of 10 meters, saw a ton of fish (sadly no turtles), and it was a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And suddenly it hit again. Am I not getting enough air? Why is the air I am exhaling sounding louder than previously when rising to the surface past my ears? Am I tiring myself too much while swimming - will my legs cramp up soon? And I swear in this moment, I felt I was not getting enough air. Funny thing is: I totally &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; getting enough air! It was all actually &lt;em&gt;completely fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
I was telling myself that something was wrong, and it immediately felt like something was actually wrong. It was as if something inside of me was still trying to resist and tell me I am going to die there, that I was not prepared, and would make a horrible mistake. And just as fast as the feeling came, it went again. I calmed myself down, and everything was ok. What the hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain plays tricks on you. And in the stress and the hectic, it is easy to fall into a negative cycle of doom and gloom. Everything seems bad as soon as you think it is bad, and in the moment, it all feels too real, and the fear and the stress are palpable and scary.&lt;br&gt;
But as fast as it all comes, it all goes. A deep breath, a nudge to relax and look at things clearly. To notice that we are alive and still breathing, privileged, and incredibly lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ginger Bug Experiments</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250707-ginger-bug-experiments/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to make my own Kombucha.&lt;br&gt;
The major hurdle however was that you need a SCOBY to get started, which you can either get from someone who donates a piece of theirs or by buying it somewhere (e.g. on the internet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my friend made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://danbos.de/posts/making-ginger-bug&quot;&gt;post about his Ginger Bug&lt;/a&gt;, I got quite excited!&lt;br&gt;
The main difference to a SCOBY is that the wild yeast doing the fermentation is already readily available on the skin of conventional over-the-counter organic ginger from your local grocery store!&lt;br&gt;
So I decided to give it a try and... failed. My friend reported the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I decided to document some highlights of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I just glanced over the instructions and bought the necessary ingredients. How hard could it be. Something that immediately throws me off is the American way of measuring everything in (standardized!) cups, tablespoons, and so on, down to 1/8th of a teaspoon!?&lt;br&gt;
Over the years I have repeatedly tried to follow American recipes and using online conversion tools because obviously, a volumetric cup of water is not the same weight as a cup of flour or sugar or even butter.&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I am also just dumb? In any case, it never works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, after setting up the starter, this is how it looked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/media/ginger_bug.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ginger Bug Starter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;The freshly set up and fed Ginger Bug&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After feeding it a teaspoon of ginger and a teaspoon of sugar every day, everything started looking as it should around day 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/media/ginger_bug2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ginger Bug Starter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Evolving Ginger Bug, slightly foamy now&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeated until day 5 or so and then put it in the fridge as vaguely indicated in the recipe.&lt;br&gt;
This would allow me to just feed it once a week because the yeast would go partially dormant at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now about the exciting part! &lt;em&gt;The ginger beer!&lt;/em&gt; I bought the swing top bottles and followed the instructions precisely.&lt;br&gt;
And I have to say it did not look bad at this point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/media/ginger_beer.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ginger Beer&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Freshly prepared Ginger Beer&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then everything basically stopped... No pressure building up, no signs of life apart from excruciatingly slowly building up sediment (which is supposed to be a good sign) and a few very small bubbles on the bottle walls.&lt;br&gt;
No satisfying popping when &amp;quot;burping&amp;quot; the sodas. Just confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited for more than 5 days, but frustration caught up and I tipped it down the kitchen sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I do something wrong? Probably.&lt;br&gt;
I even asked ChatGPT what the issue could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is my diagnosis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too little food when preparing the Ginger Bug starter:&lt;br&gt;
I fed it one teaspoon ginger and sugar respectively daily, but it should have been a tablespoon. It is possible the yeast did not have enough sustenance available to form a strong culture in the limited time span I gave it outside of the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slightly off measurements?&lt;br&gt;
I used European tea- and tablespoons and when a cup was needed I used an English teacup, which is possibly too small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The yeast was dormant when in the fridge and I used the starter directly to prepare the soda.&lt;br&gt;
The recommendation online seems to be to leave it outside for a few hours during the weekly feeding, and generally &amp;quot;waking it up&amp;quot; before preparing soda.&lt;br&gt;
I guess the yeast count was just too small and it did not ramp up fast enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used water from the sink and not mineral bottled water.&lt;br&gt;
While I think it should be fine, something in the water here could have halted the development of the yeast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other contaminants&lt;br&gt;
I did not go through the effort of sterilizing all bottles and utensils.&lt;br&gt;
While mold never formed visibly, who knows what other life forms the yeast had to compete with in this primordial soup?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would have been a possibility to try reviving the Ginger Bug, but I decided to start from zero.&lt;br&gt;
I have now bought American standardized measuring cups and spoons and have set up a new Ginger Bug starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will post an update if this one goes well! Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer and Gardening</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250703-summer-and-gardening/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was looking forward to when moving to the new flat was the larger balcony and the connected possibilities.&lt;br&gt;
While it is too narrow to properly sit and spend the whole day there, it is perfect for hanging some clothes out to dry or for a little hobby gardening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how it is looking from the back garden area (since it lies on the opposite side of the street):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/media/flowers1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Balcony&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;View of passers-by of the balcony.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/media/flowers2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Flowers Close-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/media/flowers3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Flowers Close-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the flowers in pots and simply moved them to the flower boxes. They have grown beautifully and require little to no maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend would have preferred to grow all plants from seeds.&lt;br&gt;
While I agree that is would have been much nicer, my previous experience has also been that there a many more things to watch out for.&lt;br&gt;
Mainly, the saplings need a warm temperature initially, and keeping them inside of the flat mostly just led to fungus gnats.&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I am just bad a watering them properly. In any case, it is just a lot more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I agreed to give some mini-tomatoes a try!&lt;br&gt;
They are looking good and healthy and are now positioned on the balcony, too.&lt;br&gt;
I am not sure how long it will take for them to grow some actual tomatoes, but I hope it happens before summer is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/media/tomatoes.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Tomatoes&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Tomatoes on the balcony.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
