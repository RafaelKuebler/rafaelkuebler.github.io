      <title>On respect and kindness</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250305-on-respect-and-kindness/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a day off of work today due to sickness - a massive headache and a sore throat.&lt;br&gt;
Still, I decided to go for a walk to the grocery store with my girlfriend in the afternoon, to buy some ginger, lemon, and tea.&lt;br&gt;
On the way we had to pass through a narrow passage under some train tracks. A woman was letting her dog sniff around, taking up about half of the available space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we heard the bicycle bell. The boy on it was approaching the passage slowly, while continuously and intensely ringing the bell. The woman did either not understand that the ringing was meant for her, and that she was, at least to some extent, in the way. This, or she was purposefully ignoring it, not looking even in the general direction of the ringing.&lt;br&gt;
Funnily, the kid had more than enough space to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He rolled straight up to the woman, and while pushing his bike past her in slow motion, stared her down while continuing to ring. Unfazed, the woman continued on with her dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we left the situation behind, my girlfriend and I laughed and briefly debated on what had just happened. The word that kept coming to my mind was &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;respect&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By demanding respect, in his perceived superiority at this point in time, the boy actually disrespected the woman. The woman, in her lack of awareness, or open defiance, disrespected the boy and possibly everyone that was trying to traverse the narrow passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes me sad is that this boy must have hardly lived enough experiences to truly understand what he was doing. Rather, in that moment, we saw a reflection, an imitation of his parents. Demanding respect by belittling others. By pointing out what the woman with her dog was doing wrong, how the boy knew better, and by teaching her a lesson on manners and correct social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to giving people the benefit of the doubt? What happened to basic kindness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 10 minutes later while waiting at the cash register the older man in front of us offered us a 10% discount coupon he could not combine with the other one he already had.&lt;br&gt;
We happily took it and thanked him profusely 15 times (not even exaggerating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that I took more offense at the boy trying to prove his point than at the woman blocking the way. My main reasons are that 1) the boy had plenty of space and 2) instead of just passing made special emphasis on showing the woman she was in the wrong. There was no point to prove, there was no valid reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be a father someday. I want to be a father that teaches his children respect, but more importantly, kindness. I don&#39;t want to be like this child, or how I imagine his parents to be. I want to be the kind, old man in the supermarket.&lt;br&gt;
Why, at any point in time, must we feel like we have the moral high ground with people that we have never even seen before, or will probably never see again? That we know &lt;em&gt;absolutely nothing&lt;/em&gt; about.&lt;br&gt;
On this note, And I wish them good luck, and all the best.&lt;br&gt;
I would not want to be this boy. And I wish him good luck, and all the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wonder</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250224-wonder/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this month I spent some weeks on a somewhat remote island.&lt;br&gt;
One sunny afternoon I had grabbed an ice cream and was sitting by the beach on a low wall, listening to the somewhat out of tune singing of a busker. Families were swimming, enjoying the sun, or just walking along the seaside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in between all the mundanity, another equally mundane thing really caught my attention:&lt;br&gt;
a little girl, around 1-2 years old, was playing in the mud next to the showers on the beach. She was giggling and smiling widely, rolling in the puddles and getting it all over her fresh, white clothes.&lt;br&gt;
Seeing her like this was an absolute delight. What carefreeness. The little, happy giggles! No worry in the world, a world that to her at this point in time must have seemed wonderful, generous, and just.&lt;br&gt;
And then the thought popped into my mind: what will her parents say, when they see her like this? Will this upset them? This for sure would pose some work and effort for them, washing the clothes, getting her showered and cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the next thought: is this little girl really doing anything wrong? Why would the clothes be more precious than this moment? When did the routine take the joy and the sparkles out of every single, beautifully unique moment? When did we lose our sense of wonder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we grow up and are taught that actions have consequences? When to fit in you have to act like a grown up, pay your taxes, and wash your own clothes.&lt;br&gt;
You would never see an adult rolling in the mud, laughing obliviously, smearing themselves with dirt. &amp;quot;These clothes cost me my hard-earned money!&amp;quot; - they would say. And: &amp;quot;What would the other people think!?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that I have to a large degree lost my sense of wonder. You learn to cope. When you go about your life you realize that things seem to just... &amp;quot;be&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Be&amp;quot; as in &amp;quot;exist&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The vacations just kind of &amp;quot;are&amp;quot;, a break between the busy and hectic months of work, between letters from your bank and the odd, unfriendly neighbors that never greet you in the hallway.&lt;br&gt;
The warm sunny day kind of simply &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;. There probably will be another sunny day tomorrow and if not, probably next week. The ice cream you are having is alright. But just that: alright. &amp;quot;I have had better&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this year, I want to be more reflective. I want to reconnect with that lost sense of wonder, with my inner child. Seeing the world through the eyes of that little girl on the beach. Forgetting about the worries, and the grocery store&#39;s closing times, and all the consequences. Not weighing experiences against one another or hunting for the next great, exciting, refreshingly novel thing. It is the realization that what we have and who we are is enough, and it is plenty. And all around us, at all times, there is something beautiful to wonder about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What am I doing</title>
      <link>https://rafaelkuebler.github.io/posts/20250203-what-am-i-doing/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, I somehow feel compelled to say that I don&#39;t know what I am doing, where this is going, or how it will continue.&lt;br&gt;
My one and only New Year&#39;s resolution for the year 2025 was to start and publish a blog, not even to write regularly, just to put it out there at first.&lt;br&gt;
This has previously been a struggle because of many issues that other (tech-y) writers probably have experienced: spending way too much time on finding a nice tech stack, template, and ideas, reflecting long and hard about what to write about, and finally and maybe most importantly impostor syndrome.&lt;br&gt;
I had all of these stock images already picked out that I wanted to place above each one of my posts. Now looking through them I just find them cheesy and unoriginal... Who knows, maybe I will change my opinion...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I guess I just found the discipline to actually and finally get started. Just that, a first and very small step into the unknown, towards something new and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I catch myself thinking again and again: who am I doing this for? Why? I don&#39;t expect external validation from my writing, in fact, I somehow wish this could stay private. I want to tell myself that I am doing this for me alone, a space to reflect and philosophize, where I can just write about whatever topics I find interesting right now.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, I admit that I have a small hope my mad ramblings might be at least curious to someone out there, in this big and too often very confusing world. Maybe even helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here you go, stranger :) I am truly happy you made your way here! Feel free to stick around and explore a little bit. You might find something interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
