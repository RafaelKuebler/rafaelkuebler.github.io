# About Me

Hi there! I'm Alex, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast based in San Francisco. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, experimenting with new cooking recipes, or getting lost in a good book.

## My Journey

I've been working in the tech industry for over 8 years, focusing primarily on web development and cloud architecture. My journey started with a computer science degree, but my love for technology began much earlier when I built my first website at the age of 14.

## Hobbies & Interests

- **Hiking**: I try to hit the trails every weekend, exploring the beautiful landscapes around the Bay Area
- **Cooking**: I love experimenting with different cuisines and techniques
- **Reading**: Science fiction and tech books are my go-to genres
- **Photography**: Capturing moments and landscapes during my travels
- **Open Source**: Contributing to various open-source projects in my free time

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on interesting projects. I'm always excited to meet fellow developers and tech enthusiasts!
