# About Me

I am Rafa, a calm creature driven by creativity and kindness.
I am a software engineer with a focus on backend technologies, currently working as an IT consultant in Munich.
Some of my current hobbies include this blog, learning classic Spanish guitar, cooking, watercolors, gardening, and working on game development projects.

## About the Blog

I resolved to try to embrace my creative nature more, disregarding the urge to measure the practice solely by its outcome.
As such, this blog currently is, and hopefully will remain, a space that is mainly my own. By me and for me.
I don't do this for profit, a better career, or external validation.
