# About Me

I am Rafa, a calm, creativity- and kindness-driven creature.
I am a software engineer with focus on backend technologies, currently working as IT consultant in Munich.
Some of my current hobbies include this blog, learning classic Spanish guitar, cooking, watercolors, gardening, and working on game dev projects.

## About the Blog

I resolved to try to embrace my creative anture more, disregarding the urge to see the practice as only being measurable by the outcome.
As such, this blog currently is and hopefully will stay a space that is mainly my own. By me and for me.
I don't do this for profit, a better career, or external validation.
